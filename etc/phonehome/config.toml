# PhoneHome Server Configuration
# This is an example configuration file for the phonehome application.

# IMPORTANT: Change this to a secure, random value for production use!

# If the file doesn't exist, a self-signed certificate will be generated automatically

# Path to the TLS private key file
# If the file doesn't exist, a private key will be generated automatically

# This could be a script, binary, or any executable command

[phone_home]
# List of fields to extract from the Cloud Init phone home data
# Available fields include:
# - instance_id: Cloud instance identifier
# - hostname: System hostname
# - fqdn: Fully qualified domain name
# - cloud_name: Cloud provider name (aws, gce, azure, etc.)
# - platform: Platform information
# - region: Cloud region
# - availability_zone: Availability zone
# - instance_type: Instance type/size
# - local_hostname: Local hostname
# - public_keys: SSH public keys (comma-separated)
# - local_ipv4: Local IPv4 address
# - public_ipv4: Public IPv4 address
# - local_ipv6: Local IPv6 address
# - public_ipv6: Public IPv6 address
# - mac: MAC address
# - security_groups: Security groups (comma-separated)
# You can also specify custom fields that may be present in the phone home data

# Example Cloud Init configuration to add to your user-data:
#
# #cloud-config
# phone_home:
#   url: "https://your-domain.com:8443/phone-home/your-secret-token-here-change-me-123456"
#   post: all
#   tries: 10
#
# The phone home URL format is:
# https://{server.host}:{server.port}/phone-home/{server.token}

# Example external application script (/usr/local/bin/process-phone-home):
#
# #!/bin/bash
# # Example script to process phone home data
# DATA="$1"
# echo "Received phone home data: $DATA" >> /var/log/phonehome.log
#
# # Parse the pipe-separated data
# IFS='|' read -ra FIELDS <<< "$DATA"
# TIMESTAMP="${FIELDS[0]}"
# INSTANCE_ID="${FIELDS[1]}"
# HOSTNAME="${FIELDS[2]}"
# PUBLIC_IP="${FIELDS[3]}"
# LOCAL_IP="${FIELDS[4]}"
# CLOUD_NAME="${FIELDS[5]}"
# REGION="${FIELDS[6]}"
#
# # Do something with the data (send to monitoring system, update database, etc.)
# echo "Instance $INSTANCE_ID ($HOSTNAME) is online at $PUBLIC_IP in $CLOUD_NAME/$REGION"

# Certificate Management
# The server can automatically generate self-signed certificates if the certificate
# files specified above do not exist. This is useful for testing and development.
# For production use, provide your own certificate files or use a certificate
# authority like Let's Encrypt with certbot:
#
# sudo certbot certonly --standalone -d your-domain.com
# Then update cert_path and key_path to point to the generated certificates.


# Security Notes:
# 1. Always use HTTPS in production
# 2. Use a strong, random token
# 3. Restrict access to the server using firewall rules
# 4. Regularly rotate the token
# 5. Monitor the logs for suspicious activity
# 6. Ensure the external application is secure and validated
# 7. Use proper certificate management for production deployments
# 8. Self-signed certificates should only be used for testing or internal use
